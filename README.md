## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) 

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned a lot about React context API and useReducer hook. Creating the lightbox gallery was really a challenge for me. I wasn't sure whether do I have to create a separate component or use images gallery component.  Although I finally managed to create it, I sure there are improvements that can be made.

I am also looking forward to learn more from you suggestions.



### Continued development

For this project. I did not add the appropriate shadows for the buttons and cart. I wanted to add an animation for the aside.

Also, I could'nt  get the location of the cart whenever you resize the screen.

Overall I would like to improve my react skills and also my file structure.
